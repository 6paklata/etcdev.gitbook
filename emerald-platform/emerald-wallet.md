## Usage

### Welcome

Upon first opening the Emerald Wallet application, users have an option to _generate a new ETC account_ **or** _add an existing ETC account_ using **keystore file**, **private key**, and **ledger nano s**.

When generating or adding an ETC account, Emerald Wallet will require a password. This password will be used to sign transactions on behalf of that _particular_ account.

Always backup **keystore files** and **private keys** for ETC accounts. ****Store them in a safe place.
{% endhint %}
