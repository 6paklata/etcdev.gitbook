# Installation

## Install

**Truffle**

```text
$ npm install -g truffle
```

Confirm truffle is installed, 

```text
$ truffle version
Truffle v4.1.13 (core: 4.1.13)
Solidity v0.4.24 (solc-js)
```

**Ethereum Client**

Truffle requires a personal Ethereum blockchain to run tests, commands, and inspect state while controlling chain operations. There are a few Ethereum Clients to choose from, however, for now, we will be using [Ganache](https://truffleframework.com/ganache).

## Requirements 

* NodeJS 5.0+ recommended.
* Windows, Linux or Mac OS X
* An Ethereum RPC \(Ganache at the moment\)
