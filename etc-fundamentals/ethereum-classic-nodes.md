# Ethereum Classic Nodes

## Overview

![](../.gitbook/assets/blockchain-node-overview.png)

A blockchain node is **a machine running an implementation of the blockchain**. Running an Ethereum Classic node allows a user to be part of the Ethereum Classic network enabling a user or AI to:

* Create and sign transactions
* Manage accounts
* Read information from the network
* Mine ETC
* and more...

Running an Ethereum Classic node downloads and syncs the entire blockchain to a machine. This implementation is known as a **Full Node** or **Local Node**. Since running a full node can be process intensive for some machines, users may utilize a third party implementation known as a **Light Node** or **Remote Node**.

Interactions performed on the blockchain are done through a node. Many app wallet users don't realize that their wallets submit transactions through a third party node being the wallet app provider or other party.
